    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 7, 2026</p>

    <div class="important">
      <strong>IMPORTANT — PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:</strong> These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and Borrowhood ("Borrowhood," "we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Borrowhood mobile application, website, or any related services (collectively, the "Platform"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Platform Overview</h2>
    <p>Borrowhood is a peer-to-peer platform that enables users within a geographic community to share, lend, and rent tools and other personal items. Borrowhood acts solely as a technology intermediary connecting item owners ("Owners") with individuals seeking to borrow or rent items ("Renters"). Borrowhood is not a party to any transaction between Users, does not own, possess, manage, inspect, or control any items listed on the Platform, and does not act as an agent, insurer, or guarantor for any User.</p>

    <div class="warning">
      <strong>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:</strong> Borrowhood does not own, control, offer, or manage any items listed on the platform. All items are owned and controlled solely by the users who list them. Borrowhood is not responsible for the condition, quality, safety, legality, or availability of any items.
    </div>

    <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years of age and capable of forming a binding contract to use the Platform. By registering an account, you represent and warrant that all information you provide is accurate, current, and complete. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under your account.</p>
    <p>You agree to immediately notify Borrowhood of any unauthorized use of your account. Borrowhood is not liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized account access.</p>

    <h2>3. User Roles and Premium Features</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Free Users</h3>
    <p>Free Users may lend and borrow items from friends and neighbors within their immediate neighborhood, list items for lending (non-rental), and communicate with other Users within the neighborhood scope.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Plus Subscribers</h3>
    <p>A Plus subscription ("Plus Membership") is a paid recurring membership that unlocks premium features, including but not limited to: access to town-wide browsing and content, the ability to list items for rent, reduced platform fees on rental transactions, and other benefits as described on the Platform. Plus Memberships are billed on a monthly or annual basis through Stripe, Inc. ("Stripe"), our third-party payment processor.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Identity Verification</h3>
    <p>Certain features, including town-wide browsing and rental listing, require identity verification through Stripe Identity. By using these features, you consent to Stripe's identity verification process, which may include document and selfie verification. Borrowhood does not store your identity documents; they are processed and retained by Stripe in accordance with Stripe's privacy policy.</p>
    <p>Identity verification does not constitute an endorsement, background check, or guarantee of any User's character, reliability, or trustworthiness. You should exercise your own judgment when transacting with other users.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Stripe Connect (Owner Payouts)</h3>
    <p>Owners who list items for rent must complete Stripe Connect onboarding to receive payouts. By enrolling in Stripe Connect, you agree to Stripe's Connected Account Agreement. Borrowhood is not responsible for the timing, accuracy, or availability of payouts processed by Stripe.</p>

    <h2>4. Rental Transactions</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Nature of Rental Transactions</h3>
    <p>All rental transactions are agreements solely between the Owner and the Renter. Borrowhood facilitates the transaction by providing the technology platform and payment processing infrastructure. Borrowhood is not a party to, and assumes no liability for, any rental agreement, item condition, item performance, damage, loss, theft, injury, or any other matter arising from a rental transaction.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Authorization Holds and Payments</h3>
    <p>When a Renter requests an item, an authorization hold is placed on the Renter's payment method for the total estimated rental fee plus damage deposit. This hold is not a charge. Upon pickup confirmation, the rental fee is captured. The damage deposit hold is released upon confirmed return in acceptable condition or captured in whole or in part if a damage claim is filed. Late fees may be assessed as a separate charge. All payment processing is handled by Stripe and subject to Stripe's terms of service.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Platform Fees</h3>
    <p>Borrowhood charges a platform fee on each rental transaction, deducted from the Owner's payout. The current platform fee percentage is displayed during listing creation and at checkout. Plus subscribers may receive a reduced platform fee. Borrowhood reserves the right to modify fee structures with 30 days' notice.</p>

    <h3>4.4 Damage Claims and Disputes</h3>
    <p>Owners may file a damage claim upon item return. Damage claims are processed against the Renter's damage deposit hold. If the claimed amount exceeds the deposit, an additional charge may be applied to the Renter's payment method. Borrowhood does not adjudicate, mediate, or arbitrate disputes between Users regarding item condition, damage, or damage claim amounts. Users are encouraged to resolve disputes directly. Borrowhood may, at its sole discretion, provide limited dispute facilitation but is under no obligation to do so and accepts no liability for the outcome of any dispute.</p>

    <h3>4.5 Late Returns</h3>
    <p>If an item is not returned by the agreed-upon end date, late fees accrue at the daily rate set by the Owner. Borrowhood may capture the full damage deposit as a penalty after a defined period of non-return. Persistent late returns or non-returns may result in account suspension or termination.</p>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Billing and Renewal</h3>
    <p>Plus Memberships automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (monthly or annual) unless cancelled before the renewal date. You authorize Borrowhood and Stripe to charge your payment method on file for all applicable fees.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Cancellation</h3>
    <p>You may cancel your Plus Membership at any time. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. Upon cancellation: town-wide browsing access is revoked, rental listings are hidden from search (but active rentals continue to completion), and you revert to Free User status. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Failed Payments</h3>
    <p>If a subscription payment fails, Borrowhood may retry the charge, restrict access to premium features, and ultimately cancel the subscription. You are responsible for maintaining a valid payment method.</p>

    <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
